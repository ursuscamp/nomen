# How To Get A Name

What you will need:

1. An unsigned PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction)
2. A keypair (any schnorr-compatible Bitcoin or Nostr keypair will work)
   * If you need one, use optional step below.

How it works:

You must publish your name on the Bitcoin blockchain, so you need a transaction. The easiest way to do this is to use your Bitcoin wallet to create a PSBT paid back to yourself. Before signing it, save it and we will add the necessary data to the transaction before signing and publishing it.

Make sure to overpay just slightly on fees, because will be adding a few bytes extra data to the transaction.

Once you have used a method below to add the data to the transaction, import it back to your wallet and sign it.

## Using the Explorer

1. Visit https://nomenexplorer.com
2. Click `New Name`.
3. Paste the Base64 encoded PSBT.
4. Enter the name you wish to reserve and the pubkey of the owner.
  * __Note:__ If you have a NIP-07 compatible browser extension, you can click "Use NIP-07" and it will obtain the public key from your browser extension.
5. Click `Submit` and it will build a new, unsigned transaction for you. Copy the transaction to sign and broadcast it with your wallet.
6. After broadcasting the transaction, click `setup your records` to build a new nostr records event.
7. Enter the records you wish to include. Each record must be on its own line and look like this `KEY=value`.
8. Enter you public key again, or use your NIP-07 extension.
9. Click `Create Event` and you will be presented with an unsigned Nostr event.
10. Clicking `Sign and Broadcast` will use your NIP-07 extension to sign the event and broadcast it to relays.

## Use the CLI

Configuring Nomen:

1. `nomen util init` will generate a `nomen.toml` config file with some default settings. Nomen Explorer always looks in the current working folder for the config.
2. Make sure to set the config to point to your node under the `[rpc]` section. All of the important tasks that the CLI can do rely on the presence of a full node.
3. The `[server]` section mostly just applies to running the Explorer as a web server, such as at https://nomenexplorer.com.
4. Under the `[nostr]` section, configure the relays you will use to publish events, such as `relays = ["wss://relay.damus.io"]`.

Using Nomen:

1. **OPTIONAL**: `nomen util generate-keypair` to obtain a new keypair
2. Open your Bitcoin wallet, and create a transaction that pays a Bitcoin UTXO back to you. Save that transaction (unsigned) as PSBT. Slightly overestimate your fees to account for an extra output we will add.
3. `nomen name new --privkey <PRIVATE KEY> --broadcast --output out.psbt <NAME> <PSBT>`
   * Replace PRIVATE_KEY with the hex-encoded secp256k1 private key or nsec Nostr key.
   * Replace NAME with the desired name you wish you register.
   * Replace PSBT with the path of the PSBT you created.
4. Open `out.psbt` in your Bitcoin wallet. It should now include an extra output. Sign it with your Bitcoin wallet and broadcast it.
5. `nomen name records --privkey $PRIVATE_KEY KEY1=value1 KEY2=value`
   * Create and broadcast new records to Nostr.
   * Replace key/values with records of your choosing.
